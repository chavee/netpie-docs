bezier()
========

Draws a cubic Bezier curve on the screen. These curves are defined by a
series of anchor and control points. The first two parameters specify
the first anchor point and the last two parameters specify the other
anchor point, which become the first and last points on the curve. The
middle parameters specify the two control points which define the shape
of the curve. Approximately speaking, control points "pull" the curve
towards them.<br /><br />Bezier curves were developed by French
automotive engineer Pierre Bezier, and are commonly used in computer
graphics to define gently sloping curves. See also curve().

**พารามิเตอร์**

- ``x1``  : x-coordinate for the first anchor point

- ``y1``  : y-coordinate for the first anchor point

- ``x2``  : x-coordinate for the first control point

- ``y2``  : y-coordinate for the first control point

- ``x3``  : x-coordinate for the second control point

- ``y3``  : y-coordinate for the second control point

- ``x4``  : x-coordinate for the second anchor point

- ``y4``  : y-coordinate for the second anchor point
