=========

The system variable touches[] contains an array of the positions of all
current touch points, relative to (0, 0) of the canvas, and IDs identifying a
unique touch as it moves. Each element in the array is an object with x, y,
and id properties.
The touches[] array is not supported on Safari and IE on touch-based
desktops (laptops).
