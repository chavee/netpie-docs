p5()
====

This is the p5 instance constructor.
A p5 instance holds all the properties and methods related to
a p5 sketch.  It expects an incoming sketch closure and it can also
take an optional node parameter for attaching the generated p5 canvas
to a node.  The sketch closure takes the newly created p5 instance as
its sole argument and may optionally set preload(), setup(), and/or
draw() properties on it for running a sketch.
A p5 sketch can run in "global" or "instance" mode:
"global"   - all properties and methods are attached to the window
"instance" - all properties and methods are bound to this p5 object
